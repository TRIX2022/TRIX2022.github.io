                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><br>Good day to you, brave delegate! 🦸‍♂️</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>We are very proud to have you as part of <strong>TRIX Odyssey</strong>, and we hope you will have a meaningful experience with us, but in order for that to happen you need to know a few things!&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong>1. How to Prepare for the Conference</strong>&nbsp;😺<br>
<br>Very often, in the rush of  preparing for the conference, we tend to forget some essential things at home and pack some things that are not that important instead. But don’t you worry, OC Varză has your back.&nbsp;🥬<br>
<br><em>Things to pack:</em><br>
<br>-<strong>Your cup</strong> 🥤- We are trying to make the conference as sustainable as possible. In order for that to happen we need your help, so bring your best cup and be ready to have some drinks in it at all times!&nbsp;<br>-<strong>Clothes for the party</strong> 🕶️- Make sure you have your party outfits ready and compliant with the dress code. Oh, and don’t forget your dancing shoes!
<br>-<strong>Clothes for the gala night</strong>&nbsp;👗👞 - Make sure your glamorous dress or suit shines on the “red carpet” with some STARS on it!
<br>-<strong>Warm clothes</strong>&nbsp;👚 - Vladdy Daddy’s castle can be cold, so make sure you have with you some long pants (even tho we loooove to see some leg action) and a hoodie (Vladdy is sad no cleavage is showing, but he’s happy he doesn’t have to drink cold blood).
<br>-<strong>A Romanian traditional blouse</strong> (ie - in Romanian) - so you are all ready for some cool activities Saturday!
<br><strong>-Your ID/Passport&nbsp;</strong>🆔<strong>&nbsp;</strong>- Make sure you have an identification document with you so Vladdy Daddy knows who you really are!
<br>#GoodVibesOnly!&nbsp;<br>
<br>Things to leave at home:<br>
<br><strong>Your comfort zone.
</strong><br><strong>Stress.
</strong><br><strong>Chores.
</strong><br><strong>University &amp; marks.
</strong><br>
<br>*No need to bring your own alcohol, all beverages (alcoholic or not) are free of charge at TRIX!
<br>
<br><strong>2. Rules &amp; Behaviors&nbsp;</strong>🟥<br>
<br>In order for the conference to go as smoothly as possible, and all of the delegates to have a great experience, we need to set some rules.
<br>
<br>-Be polite towards the other delegates, staff of the venue and towards the Conference Team.<br>-The use of illegal substances (you know them, we don’t need to further explain) is strictly prohibited. 
<br>-At the parties, make sure that you don’t drink more than you can handle. You can have a good time without losing your head and senses. (Intermediate and Veteran contests don’t count here, we expect you to break your head in those spaces)
<br>-There are areas especially made for smoking (cigarettes, vape etc - we are talking here about legal things, we already set that illegal substances are prohibited) so please refrain from smoking in any other areas and use the ashtrays there, please do not throw your cigarette bud on the ground.
<br>-Make sure you clean after yourself and leave the space/environment clean as you found it!
<br>-Be present at every session (not only physically), especially in the morning plenaries.
<br>Be proactive! There are no stupid questions, there are no stupid answers. 
<br>-In case you have any suggestions, feedback, concerns, questions or anything you would like to express regarding the conference, venue, logistics etc, please approach OC Varză. If you have anything to say about the sessions, agenda, content delivered by the FACI team, please approach EB Horizon (you’ll also have a feedback form for that after each day of the conference)
<br>
<br><strong>3. Check In &amp; Check Out&nbsp;</strong>🏨<br>
<br>The check in hours are between 11:30 and 13:30. 
<br>
<br>If you arrive before 11:30 you’ll have to wait for the check in to start and if you arrive after 13:30 the check in will be done in the first break that comes in the agenda. 
<br>
<br>Make sure you communicate with OCs Reception &amp; Delegate Experience (Alexandra Mânzat &amp; Roxana Cîrcu) the hour you’ll be arriving at the venue if you are not using the OC Transportation Plan and any changes in your journey to TRIX Odyssey.
<br>
<br>The check out hours will be announced later on.&nbsp;<br></p>
